# bluefin-common — Agent & Copilot Instructions

**bluefin-common** is the shared OCI layer consumed by all Bluefin image variants. Changes here propagate to `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, and `dakota`. Stay surgical.

Home repo: [projectbluefin/common](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common)

## Org pipeline — projectbluefin

```

Each image repo pulls `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest` as a base layer.
testsuite gates `:latest` promotion in all three image repos.

### Issue lifecycle

`filed → approved → queued → claimed → done`

| Stage | How |
|---|---|
| `filed` | Issue opened |
| `approved` | Maintainer adds `status/approved` or comments `/approve` |
| `queued` | `queue/agent-ready` auto-added alongside approval |
| `claimed` | Comment `/claim` — assigned, removed from pool |
| `done` | Fix shipped + 3× `ujust verify` or maintainer override |

No PR activity in 7 days returns a claimed issue to the queue automatically.

### PR comment policy

One comment per PR event, max. Combine all findings. Never post a follow-up — edit the existing comment.
Never duplicate GitHub UI state (approvals, CI status).
Test reports: what ran + pass/fail + blockers only. No diff summaries.
@ mentions only when asking someone to do something specific. Never standalone.
When in doubt, post nothing.

### Mandatory gates

- `just check` before every commit
- PR title: Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore(deps):`, etc.)
- Attribution on every AI-authored commit: `Assisted-by: <Model> via <Tool>`
- Max 4 open PRs at a time per agent
- No WIP PRs

## CODEOWNERS

```
system_files/shared/**   @inffy @renner0e @ledif @castrojo @hanthor @ahmedadan
system_files/bluefin/**  @castrojo @hanthor @ahmedadan
```

## Build and validate

```bash
just check      # lint Justfile
just build      # full container build (slow — requires podman + network)
pre-commit run --all-files   # hygiene checks (json/yaml/toml + actionlint)
```

## Submodules

- `bluefin-branding` → `projectbluefin/branding` (wallpapers, logos). `just build` initializes it automatically.
- `aurorafin-shared` → `ublue-os/aurorafin-shared` (shared system config for all variants and Aurora).

Changes to shared system config must go to `ublue-os/aurorafin-shared` in an upstream PR, not by editing `system_files/shared/` in this repo.

## Scope warning

Changes here flow into ALL downstream Bluefin variants at next build. A broken `system_files/shared/` change will break bluefin, bluefin-lts, AND dakota simultaneously. Test locally before pushing.
