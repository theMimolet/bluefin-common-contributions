# bluefin-common — Agent & Copilot Instructions

**bluefin-common** is the shared OCI layer consumed by all Bluefin image variants. Changes here propagate to `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, and `dakota`. Stay surgical.

Home repo: [projectbluefin/common](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common)

## 🚫 ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION — ublue-os org

**NEVER create issues, pull requests, comments, forks, webhook calls, API writes, automated reports, or any other programmatic action targeting any `ublue-os/*` repository.**

This applies in every situation, without exception, regardless of task framing:
- Issues, comments, PRs, forks → **BANNED**
- Automated reports (bonedigger output, CI notifications, diagnostic uploads) → **BANNED**
- Workflow `repository_dispatch` or `workflow_dispatch` calls to `ublue-os/*` → **BANNED**
- Any `gh` CLI command that writes to `ublue-os/*` → **BANNED**

If a task seems to require touching an upstream `ublue-os` repo → **stop and tell the human to report it manually.**

**Allowed reads only:**
- `ghcr.io/ublue-os` image registry pulls (CI, e2e, rollback helper)
- `gh api` read-only calls to `ublue-os` repos (e.g., checking a release tag)

Violating this risks getting the projectbluefin organization banned from GitHub.

                                 │

                                iso (installation media)
```

Each image repo pulls `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest` as a base layer.
testsuite gates `:latest` promotion in all three image repos.

**Supply chain policy:** All signing, SBOM generation, CVE scanning, and provenance attestation logic lives in `projectbluefin/actions`. Do not add inline supply chain steps to `common`'s workflows — consume the shared composite actions instead. See [docs/skills/release-promotion.md](docs/skills/release-promotion.md) and [actions#86](https://github.com/projectbluefin/actions/issues/86).

### Issue lifecycle

`filed → triage → queued → claimed → done`

Full workflow, label taxonomy, epics, project board, and PR lifecycle:
[`docs/skills/label-workflow.md`](docs/skills/label-workflow.md)

Lifecycle automation source of truth: `.github/workflows/lifecycle.yml`

### Mandatory gates

- `just check` before every commit
- `pre-commit run --all-files` before every commit
- PR title: Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore(deps):`, etc.)
- Attribution on every AI-authored commit — both trailers required (CI-enforced in `validate.yml`):
  ```
  Assisted-by: <Model> via GitHub Copilot
  Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
  ```
- Max 4 open PRs at a time per agent
- No WIP PRs
- **Never push directly to a protected branch.** Always open a PR. PRs enter the human review queue (`pr/needs-review`) and require `lgtm` from a human before merging. This applies to `common/main` too — branch protection bypass is not agent-permitted.
- **Doc-only exception:** `docs/` edits and `AGENTS.md` changes in `common` may be pushed directly to `main` without a PR.

## Session start — mandatory

Run before any other work:

```bash
~/src/hive-status
```

No arguments, no auth required, completes in under 5 seconds. Surfaces P0/P1 blockers and the advisory queue. Do not proceed without it.

## Scope discipline

Read task intent literally:

- `"work on hive priority issues"` = pick the top issue from `hive-status` output and fix it
- `"do PR reviews"` = review open PRs only — do not start fix work
- If a session could involve both, confirm scope with the user before acting

## CODEOWNERS

```
system_files/shared/**   @inffy @renner0e @ledif @castrojo @hanthor @ahmedadan
system_files/bluefin/**  @castrojo @hanthor @ahmedadan
**/*.md                  @repires @KiKaraage @projectbluefin/maintainers  (inside BEGIN/END TRIAGERS sentinel)
```

## Build and validate

```bash
just check      # lint Justfile
just build      # full container build (slow — requires podman + network)
pre-commit run --all-files   # hygiene checks (json/yaml/toml + actionlint)
```

## Submodules

- `bluefin-branding` → `projectbluefin/branding` (wallpapers, logos). `just build` initializes it automatically.

`system_files/shared/` and `system_files/nvidia/` are now directly tracked in this repo — edit them here directly.

## Scope warning

Changes here flow into ALL downstream Bluefin variants at next build. A broken `system_files/shared/` change will break bluefin, bluefin-lts, AND dakota simultaneously. Test locally before pushing.
