## Improving skill docs

All files in `docs/skills/` are community-maintained operational knowledge. They live in this repo so any contributor can update them with a direct push to `main` (doc-only exception applies).

**When to update a skill:** any time a session surfaces a workaround, non-obvious pattern, or convention. See [`docs/skills/skill-improvement.md`](skills/skill-improvement.md) for the full mandate and checklist.

**Trail of Bits skill-improver** (optional tooling for structured updates):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/trailofbits/skills --skill skill-improver
# Then in your editor: /skill-improver docs/skills/<file>
```

For the full catalog of all skill files with descriptions, see [`docs/skills/INDEX.md`](skills/INDEX.md).

## Scope rules

- **Doc tasks**: modify only `docs/` and `AGENTS.md`. Do not create `.github/` workflow files unless the task is explicitly CI work.
- **CI tasks**: touch only `.github/` and update `docs/skills/` if learnings arise.
- **Changes here propagate to all downstream Bluefin variants.** Keep changes surgical.
