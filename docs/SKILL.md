## Improving skill docs

All files in `docs/skills/` are Claude Code skills maintained with the Trail of Bits skill-improver:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/trailofbits/skills --skill skill-improver
# Then in your editor: /skill-improver docs/skills/<file>
```

## Scope rules

- **Doc tasks**: modify only `docs/` and `AGENTS.md`. Do not create `.github/` workflow files unless the task is explicitly CI work.
- **CI tasks**: touch only `.github/` and update `docs/skills/` if learnings arise.
- **Changes here propagate to all downstream Bluefin variants.** Keep changes surgical.
