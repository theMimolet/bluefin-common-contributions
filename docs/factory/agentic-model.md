# Agentic Operating Model — projectbluefin

Cross-repo agent rules. Every agent working in any factory repo MUST read this.
Per-repo specifics live in that repo's `AGENTS.md` — start there, then load this.

## Hard rules

- **AGENTS.md is the per-repo contract.** Read it before touching anything.
- **One agentic whole.** `common` changes propagate to `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, and `dakota` at next build. High blast radius.
- **Org-wide automation lives in `projectbluefin/actions`.** Treat `projectbluefin/housekeeping` as a deprecated placeholder repo, not an active home for maintenance workflows.
- **No castrojo fork.** Push branches directly to `projectbluefin/*` repos, open PRs with `gh pr create --repo projectbluefin/<repo>`.
- **Squash only.** All factory repos use squash merge. Never merge-commit or rebase-merge.
- **Max 4 open PRs per agent at once.** No WIP PRs.
- **One PR per feature.** Never batch unrelated changes into a single PR. Each logical fix or feature gets its own branch and PR, even if the code changes are small. Reviewers should be able to review and revert independently.
- **Check for existing PRs before opening.** Before creating a branch for any issue, run:
  `gh pr list --repo projectbluefin/<repo> --state open --search "<topic>"`
  If an open PR already covers the work, comment on it rather than opening a duplicate.
- **Ask before opening PRs.** Do not open PRs autonomously. Present the plan and the diff, get explicit human approval, then open. Exception: Renovate bot PRs are pre-approved.
- **`just check` before every commit** in repos that have a Justfile.
- **`pre-commit run --all-files` before every commit** in repos with `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- **Staging audit before every commit.** Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`. After any script execution, build step, or cross-repo checkout, run:
  ```bash
  git status                        # check for unexpected tracked paths
  git diff --cached --name-only     # verify only intended files are staged
  ```
  Nested `.git` directories (worktrees, auxiliary clones) stage as gitlinks and silently corrupt history.
- **Never push directly to a protected branch.** Always open a PR. PRs require `lgtm` from a human.
- **Doc-only exception in `common`:** `docs/` edits and `AGENTS.md` changes may be pushed directly to `main` — no PR required. Before using this exception, confirm every changed path is under `docs/` or is `AGENTS.md`:
  ```bash
  git diff --cached --name-only  # must show only docs/* or AGENTS.md
  ```
- **CI gates protect the OCI image artifact.** A check earns `exit 1` only if failure means a broken or wrong image ships. Process conventions (attribution, skill files, doc formatting) are self-enforced by agents and must never appear as CI gates.
- **Attribution on every AI-authored commit (convention, not a CI gate):**
  ```
  Assisted-by: <Model> via GitHub Copilot
  Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
  ```
  Include both trailers. Do not implement attribution checking as a blocking CI step.

## Smallest-change principle

**Prefer the smallest change that fully satisfies the requirement.** Only add indirection or generalization when a concrete requirement demands it. Resist scope creep — if it was not asked for, don't add it.

## What "autonomous" means for promotions

The factory is autonomous **up to the promotion PR**. For bluefin, bluefin-lts, and dakota:

1. Builds fire automatically (push to `testing` / Renovate digest bump / daily cron)
2. Post-build E2E runs automatically
3. On E2E pass, `promote-testing-to-main.yml` opens/updates a squash PR automatically
4. The release gate cosign-verifies and labels the PR `release/ready` automatically
5. **A maintainer merges the PR.** This is a deliberate human checkpoint.

Do not report the factory as broken because a promotion PR is open and waiting. Do not report it as autonomous if the PR is not merging. The correct status is: "promotion PR open, awaiting maintainer merge."

## Branch targets

| Repo | PR target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `common` | `main` | No testing branch — direct to main |
| `bluefin` | `testing` | Never `main` |
| `bluefin-lts` | `testing` | Never `main` — testing-first model, same as bluefin and dakota |
| `dakota` | `testing` | Never `main` — testing-first model, same as bluefin (PR 1004) |
| `knuckle` | `main` | Installer — no testing branch |
| `bootc-installer` | `dev` | Active work branch; `prod` triggers Flatpak release CI — never target `prod` directly |
| `testsuite` | `main` | Test repo — no testing branch |
| `actions` | `main` | Shared actions — no testing branch |

**Branch creation rule:** Always cut feature branches from the PR target, not from whatever is currently checked out.

```bash
# Before creating a branch, always fetch and branch from the target:
git fetch projectbluefin <target>
git checkout -b feat/my-change projectbluefin/<target>
# Example for bluefin (target = testing):
git fetch projectbluefin testing
git checkout -b feat/my-change projectbluefin/testing
```

Branching from the wrong base (e.g. `testing` when target is `main`, or vice versa) will cause the PR to show every diverged commit as new, polluting the diff and making review impossible. Verify before pushing:

```bash
git log feat/my-change ^projectbluefin/<target> --oneline  # must show ONLY your commits
```

## Testing-first model

**The standard for all image-producing repos** (`bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`).

### Invariants

- All PRs target `testing`. **Never open a content PR against `main`.**
- `main` only receives squash-merge promotion commits from `auto/promote-testing-to-main`.
- GHA-only changes (workflow files, docs, markdown) **must not** trigger image builds.
- `:testing` tag publishes on every BST/Containerfile-changing push to `testing`.
- `:stable` / `:latest` tag publishes when `main` receives a promotion commit.

### CI pipeline shape

```
PR → testing branch
  └─ build.yml (push trigger, paths-ignore) → BST/container build → :testing published
  └─ e2e gate (post-merge-e2e.yml or testsuite) → pass/fail
  └─ promote-testing-to-main.yml → opens auto/promote-testing-to-main PR (weekly or on e2e pass)
       └─ human merges PR → main → publish stable tags
```

### paths-ignore pattern (required in build.yml push trigger)

```yaml
push:
  branches: [main, testing]
  paths-ignore:
    - '.github/workflows/**'   # workflow changes don't affect the image
    # .github/actions/** intentionally NOT ignored if local composite actions are used
    - 'docs/**'
    - '**.md'
    - 'AGENTS.md'
```

### Migration checklist (for adopting testing-first in a repo)

- [ ] `build.yml` push trigger includes `testing`, with `paths-ignore` block above
- [ ] `promote-testing-to-main.yml` source is `testing` → target is `main`
- [ ] Renovate `baseBranchPatterns` targets `testing`, not `main`
- [ ] `track-common.yml` (or equivalent) targets `testing`
- [ ] Any `sync-main-to-testing.yml` fast-forward workflow is removed
- [ ] Branch protection: `main` requires PRs; `testing` allows direct push for automation
- [ ] `agentic-model.md` branch table updated to `testing`
- [ ] Repo `AGENTS.md` fast-path updated to say "PRs target testing, never main"

## Sensitive paths

Changes to these paths require maintainer review before merge:

| Path | Scope |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/` | All repos |
| `Justfile` | All repos |
| `build_files/` | All repos |
| `elements/` | `dakota` only |

## ublue-os absolute prohibition

**NEVER create issues, PRs, comments, forks, automated reports, webhook calls, or any programmatic write action targeting any `ublue-os/*` repository.**

- Read-only `gh api` calls to inspect `ublue-os` repos are permitted
- Everything else → **BANNED** without exception
- If a task requires `ublue-os` write access → **stop and tell the human to report it manually**

## Capturing gaps

When you discover something broken or missing in the factory during a session:

1. File a GitHub issue in `projectbluefin/common`
2. Required labels: one `kind/*` + at least one `area/*` (lifecycle guard enforces this)
3. Add `ai-context` if the gap affects how AI agents reason about the factory
4. **Do not** self-apply `hive/p0`, `hive/p1`, or `status/queued` — priority and queue admission are human decisions
5. **Do not** add it to a static doc section — docs are operating procedure, not backlogs

See [`docs/skills/label-workflow.md`](../skills/label-workflow.md) for the full label taxonomy and filing workflow.

## PR comment policy

- One comment per PR event, max. Combine all findings into one comment.
- Never duplicate GitHub UI state (approvals, CI status).
- Test reports: what ran + pass/fail + blockers only. No diff summaries.
- `@` mentions only when asking someone to do something specific. Never standalone.
- When in doubt, post nothing.

## Finding work

```bash
# P0 blockers across org
gh search issues --label "hive/p0" --owner projectbluefin --state open

# Ready for agent pickup
gh search issues --label "status/queued" --owner projectbluefin --state open
```

See [`docs/skills/hive.md`](../skills/hive.md) for the full hive label taxonomy and org board fields.
