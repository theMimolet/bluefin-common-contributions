# Automation Audit — Project Bluefin Factory

> Generated: 2026-06-09 (initial), supplemented 2026-06-10 (consistency + test plan + mantra), refreshed 2026-06-10 (drift verification — counts and gates reconciled to live state).

> **Mantra:** *Humans approve design, security, and merge. Everything else is automated, self-healing, and non-blocking.*

## Operating principle

Project Bluefin is an **agentic OS factory** — a CNCF showcase of cloud-native operating systems built with bootc. The factory's central commitment is:

> **Manual = liability.** Every step that does not require human accountability is automated, and every automated step is self-healing. Humans are reserved for design, security, and merge accountability — not orchestration, retries, or babysitting CI.

When this principle conflicts with convenience, the principle wins. New workflows must demonstrate they self-heal under the failure modes catalogued in [`failure-modes.md`](failure-modes.md) before they ship.

## Executive Summary

The projectbluefin factory is **91% automated** across **116 workflows in 7 in-scope repos** (common 11, bluefin 26, bluefin-lts 16, dakota 22, actions 22, testsuite 10, iso 9; bonedigger 2 and housekeeping 0 are out of audit scope). This audit identifies the remaining gaps and provides ready-to-deploy artifacts to reach **≥97% automation** with only the documented intentional human gates remaining.

**Key findings:**
- ISO builds are the weakest link (25% automation — fully manual dispatch); fix artifacts retained as **proposals only** (the `iso` repo is currently out of scope for this rollout)
- Supply chain tooling (SBOM, SLSA, keyless signing) is designed but not deployed
- Self-healing patterns (retry, token health) don't exist yet
- 4 of 7 non-deterministic steps are already mitigated
- **875 lines** of `promote-testing-to-main.yml` are triplicated across image repos (bluefin 343 + bluefin-lts 349 + dakota 183) and should consolidate into `projectbluefin/actions`
- **12 `@main` reusable-workflow refs** remain across image repos: 4 reusable workflows (`reusable-execute-release`, `reusable-release-gate`, `reusable-release-reminder`, `reusable-release`) × 3 consumers (bluefin, bluefin-lts, dakota) — silent behavior changes downstream
- `iso` and `bonedigger` ship without `CODEOWNERS` ([#589](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/589))
- `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`, `actions`, `iso`, and `bonedigger` have no in-repo `renovate.json`; they rely on the org-level [`projectbluefin/renovate-config`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/renovate-config) preset — this is the **intended pattern**, not a gap. Audit doc clarified rather than tracked as a defect.

**Total effort to implement all recommendations:** 9 working days (original 7 phases + 1 day consistency consolidation + 1 day test plan)

## Remaining Human Gates (Intentional — Do Not Automate)

Review-count requirements differ per repo by branch protection (verified 2026-06-10):

| Gate | Where | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2 maintainer reviews on promotion PR | `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts` | Accountability for production user-facing images |
| 1 maintainer review | `dakota`, `actions` | Lower-blast-radius repos — single reviewer is the policy floor |
| 0 required reviews (convention only) | `common` | Doc-only changes push direct to main; non-doc still convention-gated by PR |
| Human merge on `actions` repo | `actions` | Supply chain security (reusable actions = high blast radius) |
| P0/P1 priority assignment | all repos | Release impact requires judgment |
| `/unclaim` on stale PRs | all repos | Context on abandoned vs. in-progress work |

> **Note:** The audit's earlier blanket "2 maintainer reviews" claim applied only to image repos. `dakota` and `actions` enforce a 1-reviewer floor; `common` enforces zero (relies on the org's PR convention, not branch protection).

## How to Use This Audit

1. **Start with the roadmap** ([`implementation-roadmap.md`](implementation-roadmap.md)) — original 7-phase order and dependency graph
2. **Read [`consistency-audit.md`](consistency-audit.md)** — the per-image-code-removal items (C1–C5) sit alongside the roadmap phases. C2 and C3 are the cheapest wins (≤1 hour each).
3. **Read [`publish-loop-test-plan.md`](publish-loop-test-plan.md)** — defines what "the publish loop is tested" means before any phase is declared done
4. **Pick a phase or consolidation item** — Phases 1-4, 7, and consolidation C2/C3 have no dependencies and can start immediately
5. **Deploy the artifact** — Each YAML file has deployment instructions in its header comments
6. **Validate** — Each phase in the roadmap has specific validation steps; each test level in the test plan has pass criteria
7. **Track** — File GitHub issues per the tracking section in the roadmap and consistency audit

## Scope notes for this rollout

- The `projectbluefin/iso` repo is **currently out of scope**. Items #9 and #10 above (`iso-auto-rebuild.yml`, `iso-dispatch-snippet.yml`) remain in this directory as **proposals only** until iso work is re-authorized.
- T4 (Dakota build machine) is BLOCKED on hardware ([common#497](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/497)).
- T7 (MERGERAPTOR secret provisioning) is BLOCKED on human-only secret admin work.

## Design Decisions Required From Maintainers

| Decision | Context | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Keyless signing migration (#513) | Eliminates SIGNING_SECRET rotation + enables SLSA | Approve — standard practice for OIDC-capable repos |
| ISO dispatch token type | App vs. PAT for cross-repo dispatch | GitHub App (more secure, auditable) |
| MERGERAPTOR secrets (#511) | One-time admin provisioning for label sync | Provision — 5 minute task, high cumulative value |
