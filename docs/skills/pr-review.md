# PR Review Guide — projectbluefin/common

`projectbluefin/common` is the shared OCI layer consumed by every downstream variant (bluefin, bluefin-lts, dakota). A broken `system_files/shared/` change cascades to all three simultaneously. Consistent, thorough review prevents those regressions from reaching users.

This guide documents PR type taxonomy, per-type review checklists, lab testing patterns, CI gate interpretation, and test quality standards — built from live review sessions on PRs #760, #767, #768, #769, and #785.

---

## PR type taxonomy

Identify the PR type first. It determines blast radius, review depth, and whether lab testing is needed.

| Type | Paths touched | Blast radius | Lab needed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `systemd unit` | `system_files/shared/**/*.service`, `system_files/shared/**/*.timer`, `system_files/shared/**/*.path` | ALL variants | Yes |
| `systemd unit (nvidia)` | `system_files/nvidia/**/*.service` | nvidia images only | nvidia VM |
| `shell script` | `system_files/shared/usr/libexec/**`, `system_files/shared/usr/bin/**` | ALL variants | If behavior-changing |
| `dconf / GSettings` | `system_files/shared/**/*.gschema.override`, `system_files/shared/**/*.d/*.conf` | ALL variants | Optional |
| `OEM hardware hook` | `system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/user-setup.hooks.d/**`, `system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/system-setup.hooks.d/**` | Scoped to DMI gate | If DMI gate changed |
| `test addition` | `tests/**` | None (tests only) | No — run `just test` |
| `CI workflow` | `.github/workflows/**` | CI pipeline | No, but needs maintainer review |
| `doc / skill update` | `docs/**`, `AGENTS.md` | None | No — doc-only exception, push direct to main |
| `Containerfile` | `Containerfile` | ALL variants | Yes |

## Universal checklist

Apply to every PR regardless of type:

- [ ] `just check` passes (Justfile lint)
- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` passes (JSON/YAML/TOML hygiene, actionlint, SHA pinning)
- [ ] PR title follows Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore(deps):`, `docs:`, etc.)
- [ ] All `uses:` references to external GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned with a version comment — no `@main`, `@latest`, or `@v*` floating tags
- [ ] If `system_files/shared/`: blast radius acknowledged — change affects bluefin, bluefin-lts, AND dakota
- [ ] `system_files/` changes have lab verification or passing E2E CI before merge

---

## Per-type review checklists

### systemd unit

- [ ] `WantedBy=` target matches the intended boot path:
  - `multi-user.target` for network services, update daemons, background tasks — runs on all boots including headless
  - `graphical.target` only if the service genuinely requires a graphical session (e.g., GNOME-specific D-Bus activation)
  - **Do not downgrade `multi-user.target` to `graphical.target`** unless the service truly needs GNOME — this silently drops the service on non-graphical boots (PR #767: `flatpak-appstream-firstboot.service` was incorrectly changed to `graphical.target`)
- [ ] `StartLimitBurst=` and `StartLimitIntervalSec=` are in `[Unit]`, not `[Service]` — systemd ignores them in `[Service]` (PR #767: these were in wrong section)
- [ ] `Restart=on-failure` interaction with conditions:
  - `ConditionACPower=true` — if AC condition fails (not met), systemd exits `SERVICE_SKIP_CONDITION` (exit 0 from systemd's perspective), which does NOT trigger `Restart=on-failure`. Transient condition-skip is silent.
  - `ExecCondition=` — same behavior: skip-condition exits are not failures. A service that installs, then fails a later step, may be silently skipped on restart if the install step's check returns non-zero on re-entry (PR #769: GL runtime already installed → ExecCondition exits non-zero → unit skips on Restart)
- [ ] `StartLimitBurst=1` combined with rate-limiting window: if the service can be legitimately triggered multiple times in the window (e.g., brief AC plug-in fires udev → service starts → AC unplugged before activation → real plug-in later is silently dropped), consider whether the rate limit is correct (PR #768)
- [ ] `After=` includes ordering dependencies that `Wants=` alone does not provide — `Wants=network-online.target` does not guarantee network is up before the unit starts; add `After=network-online.target` if ordering matters (PR #768: `uupd.timer` missing `After=`)
- [ ] `TimeoutStartSec=` is adequate for the work being done (e.g., large flatpak updates need 900s+, not 600s)
- [ ] `RemainAfterExit=yes` is appropriate — correct for one-shot setup services that should stay "active" after completion
- [ ] `[Install]` section: its absence is intentional for udev-started units (document in review); its presence is required for timer-started or manually-enabled units
- [ ] Service name reflects current behavior — if a "firstboot" service was generalized to run on every boot, the name should be updated (PR #767: service is no longer firstboot-only)

### shell script

- [ ] `shellcheck` passes — at minimum, run `shellcheck -S warning <file>`
- [ ] SC1091 suppression (`. /path/to/sourced/file`): use `# shellcheck source=/path` annotation, not a blanket disable
- [ ] Variable quoting — unquoted variables in conditionals and loops are common failure modes
- [ ] Error handling — `set -euo pipefail` or explicit checks; silent failures in hooks cause hard-to-debug regressions
- [ ] D-Bus / systemd calls in user hooks: `systemctl --user` needs `$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` — confirm environment is available at hook execution time

### dconf / GSettings

- [ ] Override file AND lock file change together — see [`dconf-consistency.md`](dconf-consistency.md)
- [ ] Lock file path matches override key exactly (key in `00-common` → lock entry in `00-common.conf`)
- [ ] `just check` catches parity mismatches via the dconf consistency checker

### OEM hardware hook

See the full OEM pattern section below. Quick checklist:

- [ ] Version-script guard wraps idempotent-but-not-safe work; purely idempotent work lives outside it
- [ ] DMI gate is scoped to the exact target hardware: `chassis_vendor` + `sys_vendor` + `product_name` (all three)
- [ ] Version bump acknowledged: existing users re-run the versioned block — all code inside must be safe to re-run (brew install is idempotent; dconf writes and systemctl enables are safe to re-run)
- [ ] WirePlumber fragments: written to user fragment dir (`~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/`), not global system dir
- [ ] Hook is executable and follows naming convention (`NN-description`)

### test addition

See the test quality checklist below. Quick checklist:

- [ ] Full argv asserted, not substring membership — catches missing flags, wrong spawn wrapper, wrong ordering
- [ ] Key kwargs verified (`start_new_session=True` for background spawns)
- [ ] Mock expands full received command line in bats (not a collapsed label like `"mock: grubby update"`)
- [ ] Test covers failure path, not only happy path
- [ ] `just test` passes locally

### CI workflow

- [ ] All external `uses:` SHA-pinned — pre-commit enforces this, but verify in review
- [ ] New composite actions sourced from `projectbluefin/actions` where a reusable exists — do not inline logic that already lives there
- [ ] No inline supply chain steps (signing, SBOM, provenance) — consume composite actions from `projectbluefin/actions` instead
- [ ] Sensitive paths (secrets, GHCR push, cosign) need maintainer eyes
- [ ] Workflow name follows existing conventions in the repo

## Lab testing guide

See [`lab-testing.md`](lab-testing.md) for the full runbook. Summary for PR review:

### When is lab testing required?

| Change type | Lab required? |
|---|---|
| `system_files/shared/` — systemd units | Yes — all 3 variants |
| `system_files/shared/` — scripts / hooks | Yes if behavior-changing |
| `system_files/nvidia/` | Yes — nvidia variant only |
| `tests/` only | No — `just test` locally |
| `docs/` only | No |
| `Containerfile` | Yes — image must compose |

### Scope by changed path

- `system_files/shared/` → test on **bluefin**, **bluefin-lts**, and **dakota** images
- `system_files/nvidia/` → test on **bluefin-dx** (or any nvidia-enabled image)
- `system_files/bluefin/` → **bluefin** and **bluefin-lts** only (not dakota)

### What to verify

```bash
# After booting the lab VM, check for failures:
systemctl --failed
journalctl -p warning -b

# For a specific unit:
systemctl cat <unit-name>.service
systemctl status <unit-name>.service
journalctl -u <unit-name>.service -b
```

### Expected QEMU noise (ignore these)

- `nvidia-persistenced` errors — NVIDIA driver not present in QEMU
- `systemd-oomd` warnings — memory pressure in constrained VMs
- VirtIO / KVM device messages

### Baseline vs delta

Before merging, confirm the **baseline** (current image) and the **post-merge** behavior:
1. Boot current testing image → collect `systemctl --failed` and relevant journal lines
2. Merge PR → rebuild triggers automatically → boot new image → compare

---

## CI gate interpretation

| Check name | What it means | If it fails |
|---|---|---|
| `Build and push image` | OCI image composes successfully from Containerfile | Blocking — fix build error |
| `Compose PR test image` | common layer composed for E2E gate | GHCR 504/timeout = transient, re-trigger the workflow |
| `E2E — composed common suite` | GNOME common AT-SPI suite on composed image | Investigate test output; may be flaky — re-run once |
| `test` | pytest + bats unit tests | Blocking — fix test failures |
| `pre-commit` | SHA pinning, JSON/YAML/TOML hygiene, actionlint | Blocking — run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally |
| `ghost-lab` | PR-specific lab test on KubeVirt cluster | Stale pending = needs requeue (see below) |
| Renovate `dependencies` | Automated dependency update PR | Auto-merge on CI pass; no code review needed |

### Transient failures

- **GHCR 504 on `Compose PR test image`**: This is a transient GitHub Container Registry timeout, not a code problem. Re-trigger the workflow with `gh workflow run` or the GitHub UI.
- **`ghost-lab` stale pending**: The lab check can get stuck in a "pending" loop. Requeue via `gh api` (see below).

---

## ghost-lab check — requeue a stale pending check

The `ghost-lab` status check is set via the GitHub Checks API from the lab cluster. If it gets stuck in a pending state:

```bash
# Check current status
gh api repos/projectbluefin/common/commits/<SHA>/check-runs \
  --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.name == "ghost-lab") | {status, conclusion, html_url}'

# Requeue by re-triggering the lab dispatch workflow
gh workflow run ghost-lab-dispatch.yml \
  --repo projectbluefin/common \
  --ref <branch-name>

# If the check run itself needs to be reset to queued:
gh api repos/projectbluefin/common/check-runs/<check-run-id> \
  -X PATCH \
  --field status=queued
```

If the lab is unavailable, a maintainer can manually set the check to `success` with a note:

```bash
gh api repos/projectbluefin/common/statuses/<SHA> \
  -X POST \
  --field state=success \
  --field context=ghost-lab \
  --field description="manually cleared — lab unavailable"
```

## OEM hook review pattern

OEM hardware first-boot hooks live in `system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/user-setup.hooks.d/`. Full context is in [`oem-hardware-hooks.md`](oem-hardware-hooks.md).

### Version-script guard

```bash
# Pattern: work inside the guard re-runs when version bumps
run_if_new_version() {
    local version="$1"
    # ... checks ~/.local/share/ublue-os/user-setup-complete against $version
}

run_if_new_version "20260101" << 'EOF'
  # Non-idempotent or expensive work — runs only when version > stored
  dconf write /org/gnome/... "'value'"
  systemctl --user enable some.service
EOF

# Idempotent-safe work — lives OUTSIDE the guard, runs every boot
if is_this_hardware; then
    brew install --cask some-app 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

- **Inside guard**: dconf writes, systemctl enables, one-time migration tasks
- **Outside guard**: brew installs (idempotent), configuration checks, WirePlumber fragment installs (idempotent copy)

**Version bump implication**: when version changes, ALL existing users re-run the guarded block. Code inside must be safe to re-run — dconf writes and systemctl enables are idempotent by nature, but destructive operations (rm -rf, overwriting config files) need extra care.

### DMI gates

Scope to exact hardware using all three DMI fields:

```bash
if [[ "$(cat /sys/class/dmi/id/chassis_vendor)" == "Framework" ]] && \
   [[ "$(cat /sys/class/dmi/id/sys_vendor)" == "Framework Computer LLC" ]] && \
   [[ "$(cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_name)" == "Framework Desktop" ]]; then
    # hardware-specific setup
fi
```

- Using only `product_name` can match unrelated hardware with the same name across vendors
- `chassis_vendor` + `sys_vendor` + `product_name` together uniquely identifies the target
- **QEMU lab caveat**: `/sys/class/dmi/id/product_name` in QEMU VMs is typically `"Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)"` or similar — DMI gate will correctly NOT fire. Verify this in lab to confirm the install block is a no-op on non-target hardware.

### WirePlumber fragments

WirePlumber user-space audio profiles must be written to the **user** fragment directory:

```
~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/    ← correct (user-setup hook)
/usr/share/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/   ← wrong for user hooks (system-level, would need root)
```

The copy should be idempotent — check if the target exists and matches before writing, or use `install -m 644` which overwrites safely.

## Test quality checklist

Derived from review of PR #785 (unit tests for check-oci-refs, bazaar-hook, hardware hooks, nvidia-flatpak-sync).

### Python unit tests (pytest / mock)

**Assert full argv, not substring membership:**

```python
# BAD — misses --cask flag, wrong positional order, wrong spawn wrapper
assert "brew" in " ".join(mock_popen.call_args_list[0][0][0])

# GOOD — catches all of these
mock_popen.assert_called_once_with(
    ["brew", "install", "--cask", "some-app"],
    start_new_session=True,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
)
```

**Verify key kwargs:**
- `start_new_session=True` — required for background spawns that must survive the parent
- `env=` override — if the script sets environment variables, assert they are passed
- `cwd=` — if the script changes directory before the call

**Cover failure paths:**
- Non-zero return code from subprocess
- Missing file / path not found
- Permission error

**Mock granularity:**
- Mock at the level of the function under test, not the underlying OS call — `patch("module.subprocess.Popen")` not `patch("subprocess.Popen")` to avoid cross-module leakage

### Bats tests (shell)

**Echo the full received command line from mocks:**

```bash
# BAD — collapses all grubby calls to the same label, loses argument content
function grubby() { echo "mock: grubby update"; }

# GOOD — emits full argv, allows assertion on specific arguments
function grubby() { echo "mock: grubby $*"; }
```

Then assert against specific content:

```bash
run some-script-under-test
assert_output --partial "grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args=blacklist=nouveau"
```

**Framework mock pitfall**: if the bats test framework provides a mock helper that collapses argv to a label, do not use it for commands where the argument list matters. Write a minimal function mock instead.

**Assert `--now` and `--args` content:**

```bash
# BAD — discards content
assert_output --partial "systemctl enable"

# GOOD — verifies the full invocation including --now and service name
assert_output --partial "systemctl enable --now some.service"
```
