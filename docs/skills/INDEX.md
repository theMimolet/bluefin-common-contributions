# docs/skills — Index

Agent-agnostic skill docs for the `projectbluefin/common` repo. These apply to any agent (Copilot, Claude, etc.) working in this repository.

## What belongs here

Workflow knowledge, architectural context, and operational runbooks that any agent needs to work effectively in this repo.

## What does NOT belong here

Agent-specific instruction files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.) are loaded separately by their respective tools and must not be listed here.
