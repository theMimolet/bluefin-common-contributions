# docs/skills — Index

Agent-agnostic skill docs for the `projectbluefin/common` repo. These apply to any agent (Copilot, Claude, etc.) working in this repository.

## What belongs here

Workflow knowledge, architectural context, and operational runbooks that any agent needs to work effectively in this repo.

## What does NOT belong here

Agent-specific instruction files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.) are loaded separately by their respective tools and must not be listed here.

## Factory docs

| File | What it covers |

| [../factory/IMPROVEMENTS.md](../factory/IMPROVEMENTS.md) | **Why we rewrote Bluefin** — narrative by area (build, CI, lifecycle, agentic model, QA, security). Living doc; agents append as improvements land. |
| [../factory/agentic-model.md](../factory/agentic-model.md) | Cross-repo agent rules — hard rules, smallest-change principle, branch targets, sensitive paths, doc-only push exception, ublue-os prohibition |

## QA and promotion docs
