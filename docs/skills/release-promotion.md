## Promotion criteria

A `common` release is safe when **all** of the following are true:

| Criterion | How to verify |
|---|---|
| Post-merge E2E is green | Check `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` run on latest `main` commit |
| No open `do-not-merge` PRs targeting `main` | `gh pr list --repo projectbluefin/common --label do-not-merge` |
| No open P0 issues | `~/src/hive-status` — zero 🔴 blockers |
| Promotion-candidate E2E passed this week | Check `.github/workflows/promotion-candidate-e2e.yml` (runs Tuesdays) — no open blocker issue from it |

If any criterion fails, **do not tag a release**. File or escalate the blocker issue and wait.

> **Planned gate (common#513):** The monthly `release.yml` will be updated to run the promotion-candidate E2E as a required prerequisite job before creating the GitHub Release. Until that ships, the check above is manual.

## Monthly release cadence

- **Schedule:** 1st of every month at 00:00 UTC (`release.yml` cron)
- **Tag format:** `v<YEAR>.<MONTH>` — e.g., `v2026.06`
- **What it creates:** A GitHub Release with a changelog since the previous tag, pointing at the current `main` HEAD
- **What it does NOT do:** Promote or retag the OCI image — `:latest` is always the most recent merge to `main`

## Emergency hotfix release

When a critical fix needs a versioned tag outside the monthly window:

1. Merge the fix to `main` via normal PR process
2. Verify all promotion criteria above are met
3. Run `release.yml` manually via `workflow_dispatch` — it will tag the current `main` with the current month's tag (or create a patch tag manually with `gh release create`)
4. Notify downstream image repos if the fix affects their builds

## Supply chain — current state and planned improvements

> **Note:** Supply chain tooling for this repo is being centralized. Do not add inline signing, SBOM, or scanning logic to `build.yml`. All of that belongs in `projectbluefin/actions`.

| Practice | Current state | Tracking |
|---|---|---|
| OCI image signing | ✅ Keyless OIDC — live as of 2026-06-11 ([common#595](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/595)) | `SIGNING_SECRET` removed — do not reference in new workflows |
| SBOM | ✅ syft — bundled in `sign-and-publish` composite action | — |
| SLSA L2 provenance | ✅ GitHub Actions attestation — bundled in `sign-and-publish` | — |
| CVE scanning | ✅ Trivy gate — bundled in `sign-and-publish` | — |
| Changelog quality | ✅ `git-cliff` — live as of [common#592](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/pull/592) | — |

### Keyless signing — required permissions

`sign-and-publish` composite action requires these permissions on the calling job:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write        # OIDC token for keyless signing
  attestations: write    # GitHub SLSA L2 attestation
  packages: write        # push to GHCR
  security-events: write # Trivy CVE gate upload
```

Do **not** add `SIGNING_SECRET` to new workflows — keyless OIDC has replaced it.

## Verifying a published artifact

### Verify cosign signature (legacy — key-based, pre-2026-06-11)

```bash
cosign verify \
  --key https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectbluefin/common/main/cosign.pub \
  ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest
```

### Verify GitHub attestation (live — keyless, as of common#595)

```bash
gh attestation verify \
  oci://ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest \
  --repo projectbluefin/common
```

### Verify SBOM attachment

```bash
# List attached referrers (SBOM, signatures, attestations)
oras discover ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest

# Pull the SBOM
cosign verify-attestation \
  --type cyclonedx \
  ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest | jq .payload | base64 -d | jq .
```

## PR-based release model (current)

As of 2026-06-09, all three image repos (bluefin, bluefin-lts, dakota) use a **PR-based squash promotion** model. There are no more scheduled release workflows.

### How it works

```
testing branch builds (Renovate, feature PRs)
       │
       ▼ push to testing
promote-testing-to-main.yml (daily + on push)
       │
       ├── creates/updates auto/promote-testing-to-main branch (squash of testing)
       ├── opens or updates the promotion PR (testing → main)
       ├── runs release gate checks (cosign verify, E2E)
       └── attempts to enqueue PR in merge queue
                │
                ▼ maintainer approves → PR merges
       execute-release.yml (on PR close)
               │
               ├── re-verifies cosign signatures
               ├── promotes :testing digest to :stable (via skopeo copy)
               └── calls reusable-release.yml for release notes + GitHub Release
```

### Schedule

`promote-testing-to-main.yml` runs on three triggers:
- Push to `testing` branch
- Daily `cron: '0 23 * * *'` (refreshes promotion PR even with no testing activity)
- `workflow_dispatch` (manual override)

The daily heartbeat ensures the promotion PR stays fresh and gate checks are re-run.

### After merge: sync back

`sync-main-to-testing.yml` fires on every push to `main` and merges `main` back into `testing` (using `reusable-sync-branches.yml` from `projectbluefin/actions`). This prevents `testing` from falling behind after the squash-merge, which would block the next promotion PR.

### Repo variants

| Repo | testing source | target tag | fast_forward_branch |
|---|---|---|---|
| bluefin | `testing` branch | `stable` | — |
| bluefin-lts | `testing` branch | `lts` | `lts` |
| dakota | `testing` OCI tag | `stable` | — |

**bluefin-lts** fast-forwards the `lts` branch to the squash merge commit after each promotion so that `lts` always points to the latest promoted content.

**dakota** differs from bluefin/lts: rather than squashing git commits, `promote-testing-to-main.yml` resolves the current `:testing` OCI digest and writes it to `.github/release-state.yaml` on the promotion branch.

### Dakota E2E

Dakota's promotion gate runs with `run_e2e: true`. If it gets disabled, re-enable by setting `run_e2e: true` in `dakota/.github/workflows/promote-testing-to-main.yml` and verify the dakota build machine is healthy.

### Approval

The promotion PR requires **2 reviews from `@projectbluefin/maintainers`** (enforced by merge queue / branch protection). The `github-actions[bot]` token cannot self-approve — at least one human must approve before the PR can be enqueued.

`workflow_dispatch` is available on all three `promote-testing-to-main.yml` workflows for out-of-band promotion attempts.

## Promotion pipeline consistency epic (#516)

The three image repos (bluefin, bluefin-lts, dakota) currently use inconsistent pipeline models. Epic [#516](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/516) tracks bringing them into alignment on a shared "build once, promote the artifact" model.

**Known gaps being tracked:**

| Issue | Repo | Gap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

| [#518](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/518) | bluefin | `:testing` tag pushed before e2e | ✅ Closed |
| [#519](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/519) | bluefin-lts | No 7-day promotion floor | ✅ Implemented (7-day floor present in `scheduled-lts-release.yml`) |
| [#520](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/520) | dakota | Weekly promotion ran Sunday, not Tuesday | ✅ Closed |
| [#521](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/521) | dakota | No cosign verify before final promotion | ✅ Closed |
| [#522](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/issues/522) | dakota | No full e2e at weekly promotion time | ✅ Closed |

| — | bluefin-lts | `scheduled-lts-release.yml` used fragile dispatch+poll (`gh workflow run` → sleep → `gh run list` poll → `gh run watch`) | ✅ Fixed 2026-06-07 (bluefin-lts PR #118 — replaced with `workflow_call` to `reusable-release.yml`) |
| — | bluefin, bluefin-lts, dakota | Local `renovate.yml` duplicated runner logic; `renovate-automerge.yml` duplicated PR-lookup+merge logic | ✅ Fixed 2026-06-07 (all three repos PR merged — call `reusable-renovate.yml` + `reusable-renovate-automerge.yml` from actions) |
| — | bluefin | `no-floating-action-tags` pre-commit hook missing `(?!.*projectbluefin/)` exemption — would fail on valid internal `@main` refs | ✅ Fixed 2026-06-09 (bluefin PR #472) |

| — | dakota | `execute-release.yml` used `project_name: Bluefin dakota` (wrong casing) | ✅ Fixed 2026-06-09 (dakota PR #760) |
| — | common | `promotion-candidate-e2e.yml` auto-filed issues with emoji in title | ✅ Fixed 2026-06-09 (common PR #539) |

**⚠️ bluefin-lts PR #73 (`feat/shared-workflow-migration`)** is pending review and rewrites the LTS build workflows + renames all LTS images. Do not implement #517 until #73 merges.

## Troubleshooting the testing→main squash promotion

`promote-testing-to-main.yml` squash-merges `testing` onto `main` by doing:

```bash
git checkout -B auto/promote-testing-to-main origin/main
git merge --squash origin/testing
git commit -m "chore: promote testing to main"
git push --force origin auto/promote-testing-to-main
```

### Gate stuck — release/blocked with no E2E evidence

**Symptom:** The promotion PR has `release/blocked` and the sticky gate comment reads:
> No completed post-testing-e2e run found for suites smoke,common on this PR head SHA.

The gate queries `GET /repos/{repo}/actions/runs?head_sha={TESTING_SHA}`. It looks for a completed run matching `post-testing-e2e.yml` (bluefin) or `Post-Merge E2E — Testing Parity` (bluefin-lts) associated with that exact SHA.

**Root causes in priority order:**

1. **E2E workflow only fires on main branch builds, not testing** — check `branches:` filter on the `workflow_run` trigger in `post-testing-e2e.yml` / `post-merge-e2e.yml`. Must be `[main, testing]`.
2. **The fix is on `testing` but not yet on `main`** — `workflow_run` triggers use the default branch (main) workflow file. A fix to the branches filter only takes effect once it reaches main.
3. **Gate jq selector mismatch** — the `reusable-release-gate.yml` selector uses `contains("post-merge e2e")` (hyphenated). Any variation (space instead of hyphen) silently fails to match.

**Manual escape for the current cycle (bluefin only):**

```bash
# Comment /e2e on the open promotion PR to manually trigger E2E evidence
# Must be done by a maintainer with write access
gh pr comment <N> --repo projectbluefin/bluefin --body "/e2e"
```

Once the E2E passes for the testing SHA and the gate clears, the promotion PR auto-enqueues. After that first promotion, the fix lands on main and the system is self-sustaining.

**LTS and dakota** have no circular dependency — their PRs target main directly. Merging the fix PR is sufficient.

### UD (Updated/Deleted) conflict

**Symptom:** `promote-testing-to-main.yml` fails with `Automatic merge failed` and `git status` shows lines like:

```
UD .github/workflows/scheduled-stable-release.yml
UD .github/workflows/weekly-testing-promotion.yml
```

`UD` means: **testing deleted** the file, but **main still has it** (or vice versa). This happens when a PR removes a workflow from `testing` (e.g., consolidating to a reusable in `projectbluefin/actions`) but the deletion hasn't reached `main` yet.

**Resolution:** Accept the deletions from `testing` — they represent the intended state:

```bash
cd ~/src/bluefin
git fetch projectbluefin main testing
git checkout -B fix/rebuild-squash-promo projectbluefin/main
git merge --squash projectbluefin/testing  # will fail with UD conflict

# For each UD file, accept the deletion from testing:
git rm .github/workflows/scheduled-stable-release.yml

git commit -m "chore: promote testing to main"
git push projectbluefin fix/rebuild-squash-promo:auto/promote-testing-to-main --force
```

Then re-run `promote-testing-to-main.yml` via `workflow_dispatch` — it will detect the squash branch already matches testing and proceed to the enqueue step.

**Verify it's pre-existing** before touching anything: check if the `promote-testing-to-main.yml` run that failed predates your own merged PR. If it does, the conflict is not yours to own — but you can still fix the squash branch.

### Merge queue enqueue blocked

After rebuilding the squash branch, if `enqueuePullRequest` fails with:

```
Required status check "PR Validation — testsuite/validate (pull_request)" is expected.
```

The PR's CI checks have not yet completed against the new squash-branch HEAD. Wait for the `PR Validation — testsuite` workflow run to finish, then retry the enqueue.

If the error is `At least 1 approving review is required`:

- The `github-actions[bot]` (app ID 15368) is **not** in the bypass actors for `main-review-required-with-renovate-bypass`. It cannot self-approve.
- An OrganizationAdmin must approve the PR. The workflow's enqueue step will retry after approval.
- As a last resort, use `gh pr merge <N> --squash --admin` to bypass (only valid for org admins).

### Branch policy on `projectbluefin/actions`

`projectbluefin/actions` has a branch policy that blocks non-admin merges (including the agent token). PRs to `actions` always require a human to merge. After merge, the `@v1` tag must be force-pushed:

```bash
cd ~/src/actions
git tag -f v1 HEAD
git push --force origin v1
```

---

## Reusable workflow patterns (actions v1)

All image repos now delegate to shared reusables in `projectbluefin/actions`. Pin to the v1 SHA.

### Release generation — `reusable-release.yml`

Supports two SBOM modes:

| Mode | When to use | Key inputs |
|---|---|---|
| **Artifact mode** (default) | Build pipeline uploads a SBOM artifact (e.g. `reusable-build.yml` runs with `stream_name: stable`) | `build_workflow`, `build_branch`, `sbom_artifact` |
| **Inline mode** | No SBOM artifact (promote-from-testing weekly path, LTS weekly path) | `generate_sbom_inline: true`, `syft_version` (default v1.44.0) |

Use `checkout_ref` when the caller runs on `main` but the release should reflect a different branch (e.g. `checkout_ref: lts` for bluefin-lts).

**Critical**: `reusable-release.yml` always has `environment: production` on the `image-release` job — this is the R3 human gate. Do NOT remove it.

### Renovate runner — `reusable-renovate.yml`

Image repos keep their own `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch` wrapper and delegate the job:

```yaml
jobs:
  renovate:
    uses: projectbluefin/actions/.github/workflows/reusable-renovate.yml@<sha> # v1
    with:
      dry_run: ${{ inputs.dry_run == true }}
    secrets:
      renovate_token: ${{ secrets.RENOVATE_TOKEN }}
```

`persist-credentials: false` is enforced in the reusable — callers do not need to set it.

### Renovate auto-merge — `reusable-renovate-automerge.yml`

Image repos keep their `workflow_run` trigger (must reference the repo-specific CI workflow name) and delegate the PR lookup + squash-merge:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["<repo-specific CI workflow name>"]
    types: [completed]
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  automerge:
    if: github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'
    uses: projectbluefin/actions/.github/workflows/reusable-renovate-automerge.yml@<sha> # v1
    with:
      head_sha: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}
      # base_branch defaults to 'testing' — override only if needed
```

The `workflow_run` trigger CANNOT be in a reusable workflow — it must stay in the caller. Only the job logic is centralised.
