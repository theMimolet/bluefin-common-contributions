## SHA pinning policy

**All third-party `uses:` references must be pinned to a full commit SHA with a version comment.** Floating tags (`@v4`, `@main`, `@latest`) are rejected by the pre-commit hook.

### Why

Floating tags are a supply chain attack vector. Any upstream action can be compromised and inject malicious code on the next workflow run without any change to your workflow file. SHA pins guarantee bit-for-bit reproducibility.

### The pattern

```yaml
# correct — full SHA + human-readable version comment
uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4
uses: taiki-e/install-action@be26d15a6e9c3a1e0696f6f1f5e56b4e46d08c29 # v2.47.0

# rejected by pre-commit
uses: actions/checkout@v4
uses: actions/checkout@main
uses: taiki-e/install-action@latest
```

### How to find the SHA for an action

```bash
# look up the tag's SHA
gh api repos/{owner}/{action}/git/ref/tags/{version} --jq '.object.sha'

# example
gh api repos/actions/checkout/git/ref/tags/v4.2.2 --jq '.object.sha'
```

### How to update a pinned SHA

1. Look up the new tag's SHA (command above)
2. Update the `uses:` line: `@<new-sha> # <new-version>`
3. Renovate handles most updates automatically once pins are tracked

### Internal `projectbluefin/` refs — different policy

Internal reusable workflow refs use a coordinated policy, not blanket SHA pinning:

- `lifecycle-caller.yml` files pin `projectbluefin/common/.github/workflows/lifecycle.yml@<SHA>` — Renovate manages those SHA updates
- The old `projectbluefin/bonedigger/.github/workflows/lifecycle.yml@main` exemption was retired when lifecycle ownership moved into `common`
- Other internal `projectbluefin/` refs follow repo-local policy comments — read the comment before converting
- Coordinate with maintainers before changing an internal ref policy

---

## Floating-tag guard

**Scope:** shared pre-commit hook active in `common`, `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`, `actions`. Parity work pending in other repos.

**Regex:** `uses:(?!.*projectbluefin/).*@(main|master|latest|v[0-9])`

The `no-floating-action-tags` hook blocks commits of workflow files containing floating `uses:` refs. It scans `.github/workflows/` YAML files. Internal `projectbluefin/` refs are explicitly exempted via the negative lookahead — `@main` on `projectbluefin/actions` reusable workflows is intentional.

### What it blocks

Third-party actions must be pinned to a full commit SHA with a human-readable version comment. These floating refs are rejected:

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v4
uses: actions/checkout@main
uses: taiki-e/install-action@latest
```

### Managed `projectbluefin/` refs

The ACMM audit treats some internal reusable workflows as a documented policy exception, not a lint cleanup target. `projectbluefin/` internal reusable workflows should follow the repo-local policy comments rather than blanket float-to-`@main` cleanup.

### Renovate vs pre-commit

These two protections do different jobs:

- **The pre-commit hook** prevents new floating tags from entering the codebase
- **Renovate** updates existing SHA pins automatically once they are tracked

Use both. The hook enforces that refs are pinned at commit time. Renovate keeps them fresh.

## Skill drift detection

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/skill-drift.yml`

`skill-drift.yml` is a PR gate used across projectbluefin repos. In `common`, it calls the reusable workflow `projectbluefin/actions/.github/workflows/skill-drift-check.yml` at a pinned commit SHA (so the local floating-tag guard does not reject the caller).

### Repo path mapping

| Repo | code-paths | skill-paths |
|---|---|---|
| common | `.github/workflows/**`, `system_files/**`, `Containerfile`, `Justfile` | `docs/skills/**`, `docs/*.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| bluefin | `.github/workflows/**`, `build_files/**`, `Justfile`, `recipes/**` | `docs/skills/**`, `docs/*.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| bluefin-lts | `.github/workflows/**`, `build_files/**`, `Justfile` | `docs/skills/**`, `docs/*.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| dakota | `.github/workflows/**`, `build_files/**`, `Justfile`, `elements/**` | `docs/skills/**`, `docs/*.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| knuckle | `.github/workflows/**`, `cmd/**`, `internal/**`, `Justfile`, `scripts/**` | `docs/skills/**`, `docs/*.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| testsuite | `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**`, `tests/**`, `scripts/**` | `docs/skills/**`, `docs/*.md`, `AGENTS.md` |

### When it fires

A PR that touches any repo's `code-paths` without also touching one of its `skill-paths` triggers the check. Currently advisory (warns but does not block merge) — treat as a hard requirement.

Full path-to-skill mapping and waiver process: [`skill-drift.md`](./skill-drift.md)

## Renovate OCI digest tracking

`Containerfile` has two OCI image pins tracked by Renovate:

1. `docker.io/library/alpine:latest@sha256:...` via Renovate's built-in `dockerfile` manager
2. `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-wallpapers-gnome:latest@sha256:...` via a custom regex manager in `.github/renovate.json5`

### Why both managers exist

- `FROM docker.io/library/alpine:latest@sha256:...` is a standard Dockerfile dependency — the built-in `dockerfile` manager handles it
- `COPY --from=ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-wallpapers-gnome:latest@sha256:...` is not covered by the default parser — a custom regex manager tracks it

### Rule when adding OCI pins

If you add new OCI image pins to `Containerfile`, also update `.github/renovate.json5` so Renovate can keep them current. Applies to both `FROM` and `COPY --from=` references. An untracked pin silently goes stale.

---

## Renovate versioned-binary tracking

`.github/renovate.json5` tracks versioned binaries downloaded in the build stage via custom regex managers:

| Binary | Source | Renovate pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `bonedigger` | `projectbluefin/bonedigger` GitHub releases | `BONEDIGGER_VERSION` in `system_files/bluefin/usr/share/ublue-os/just/60-bonedigger.just` |

When adding a new binary pinned to a specific version in a script or just file, add a corresponding regex manager entry in `renovate.json5` so the version stays current automatically.

---

## Removing a shell script from common — 4 mandatory touch-points

When deleting `system_files/bluefin/usr/bin/<script>`, check all four:

| File | What to remove |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml` | The script path from the shellcheck `run:` block |
| `.github/workflows/validate.yml` | The `shellcheck` step that invokes it (if script-specific) **and** any `candidates.append(Path("..."))` entry in the Python OCI-ref guard |
| `system_files/bluefin/usr/share/ublue-os/just/system.just` | The `just` target and all aliases |
| `docs/skills/` | The script's skill file (if it has one) + its `INDEX.md` row + `SKILL.md` routing row + all cross-references |

### Dead apt step hazard

If the `validate.yml` shellcheck step was the **only** consumer of `Install shellcheck` in that job, delete the apt install step too — it becomes a silent no-op that wastes ~20 seconds per CI run and confuses future readers.

### Cross-reference sweep

After deleting the script and its skill file, run:
```bash
grep -rn "<script-name>" docs/ specs/ --include="*.md" --include="*.json"
```
Common survivors: `devmode.md` advisories, `image-registry.md` section headers, `acmm-audit-level2.md` risk statements, `specs/` JSON chunks.
