## What the hive is

The hive is the agentic operations layer for the projectbluefin factory. It combines three components to form a closed self-improvement loop:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  KubeStellar Hive                                   │
│  ACMM orchestration — agents at increasing autonomy │
└────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                 │
     ┌───────────┴───────────┐
     ▼                       ▼
bonedigger              kubestellar-bot
(client + lifecycle)    (implementation agent)

ujust report            picks up status/queued issues
└─ agent collects  ───▶ implements fixes, ships PRs
   system diagnostics   back to the image repos
   humans can't
└─ files structured          │
   issue to image repo       ▼
                        better OS
                             │
                             ▼
                        better bonedigger
                             │
                             └─── loop
```

**bonedigger** runs on user systems. `ujust report` triggers it: an agent collects diagnostics, scrubs PII on-device, files a structured issue. Priority auto-escalates from `ujust confirm` counts (3+ → `priority/p1`, 5+ → `priority/p0`).

**kubestellar-bot** picks up `status/queued` issues from across the factory repos and dispatches agents to implement fixes. It ships PRs back and manages the claim lifecycle.

**The hive** (KubeStellar Hive dashboard at https://kubestellar.io/live/hive/bluefin/) provides the orchestration layer, ACMM scoring, and the agent dispatch queue.

The org board mirrors the queue: https://todo.projectbluefin.io

## Label taxonomy

### Hive labels (dynamic)
Reset each cycle by hive agents and human triage.

| Label | Color | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `hive/p0` | 🔴 `#d93f0b` | Release blocker — must be fixed before next image promotion |
| `hive/p1` | 🟠 `#e4a117` | Must land this cycle |

**`hive/*` vs `priority/*`:** `priority/p0` is the repo's static backlog ordering. `hive/p0` means the hive is **actively tracking this as a blocker right now**. An issue can have both.

### Queue labels
| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status/queued` | Ready for an agent to pick up — no blockers |
| `status/claimed` | Agent has claimed this, work in progress |
| `status/hold` | Do not close or auto-merge yet |
| `agent/blocked` | Agent hit a blocker — needs human input before continuing |

## Finding work

```bash
# P0 blockers — start here every session
gh search issues --label "hive/p0" --owner projectbluefin --state open --json number,title,repository

# P1 this-cycle
gh search issues --label "hive/p1" --owner projectbluefin --state open --json number,title,repository

# Ready for agent pickup
gh search issues --label "status/queued" --owner projectbluefin --state open --json number,title,repository

# Live snapshot (from ~/src)
just hive
```

Or run `~/src/hive-status` for the full P0/P1 + advisory summary — mandatory at session start.

---

## Setting hive labels

Hive labels are set by:
1. Human triage at cycle start
2. Automated hive agents reviewing open issue queues
3. Agents self-escalating via `gh issue edit --add-label "hive/p0"`

Labels are reset between cycles — stale hive labels should be removed when an issue is resolved or deprioritized.
