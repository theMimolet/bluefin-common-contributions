# Human Decision Gates

Agents implement autonomously **except** at these four gates. At each gate, stop work, open a draft PR, and request human input explicitly. Never guess past a gate.

---

## The Four Gates

### 1. Design Gate

**Stop when:** You are about to make an architecture change, introduce a new subsystem, or change behavior that is visible to users.

Examples:
- Changing how images are built or composed
- Adding a new pipeline stage or automation system
- Changing defaults that affect what users see or can do
- Restructuring the repo layout or CI model

**Action:** Open a draft PR with your proposed design. Write a clear description of what you're proposing and why. Tag with `pr/needs-review` and explicitly state you are at a design gate.

---

### 2. Security Gate

**Stop when:** Your change touches authentication, signing, supply chain, secrets handling, or third-party package sources.

Examples:
- Adding a new COPR repo or third-party RPM source
- Changing cosign or SBOM logic
- Adding or modifying secrets in workflows
- Changing how packages are verified or pinned
- Any change to the signing or attestation pipeline

**Action:** Open a draft PR. State exactly which security property is affected and what your proposed approach preserves or changes. Security changes require maintainer review regardless of how minor they appear.

---

### 3. Breakage Gate

**Stop when:** Your change removes or renames a public input, changes a default that consuming repos depend on, or could break `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`, `aurora`, or `bazzite`.

Examples:
- Renaming or removing a workflow input used by downstream callers
- Changing a system file path that other scripts reference
- Modifying `projectbluefin/actions` in a way that could break consumers
- Changing a dconf key or GSettings schema that affects downstream images

**Action:** Identify all affected consumers before opening the PR. List them in the PR description. Confirm no consumer will silently break. If cross-repo coordination is needed, note that explicitly.

> ⚠️ `common` changes propagate to ALL downstream variants at next build. A broken `system_files/shared/` change breaks `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, AND `dakota` simultaneously.

---

### 4. Merge Gate

**Stop when:** Your PR is ready for final review and merge.

This gate is always human. CI passing + `lgtm` label from a human reviewer is required before merge. Auto-merge fires only after both conditions are met.

Agents never self-merge, never bypass branch protection, and never force-push to a protected branch.

---

## How to Signal a Gate

When you hit a gate:

1. Open a draft PR (or convert existing PR to draft)
2. Add a comment stating which gate you've hit and what decision is needed:
   ```
   Hitting the Security Gate — need human review before proceeding.

   Proposed change: [describe it]
   Security property affected: [what it is]
   My approach: [what you're proposing]
   Alternative approaches: [if any]
   ```
3. Add the `agent/blocked` label
4. Stop. Do not implement past the gate waiting for a response.

## Verification Evidence Requirement

Before removing draft status and requesting formal review, ALL of the following must be true:

- [ ] CI is passing (link the run in the PR description)
- [ ] If no automated test covers the change — describe how you manually verified it
- [ ] Skill file update committed in **this same PR** (not a follow-up)
- [ ] PR title follows Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- [ ] Both attribution trailers present on every AI-authored commit:
  ```
  Assisted-by: <Model> via GitHub Copilot
  Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
  ```

Do not request review until all five are checked. A PR without evidence is not ready.

## When in Doubt

If you are uncertain whether something hits a gate — it does. Open a draft PR, describe what you're doing and what you're uncertain about, and ask. A short human answer costs less than a wrong implementation.
