# Human Decision Gates

Agents implement autonomously **except** at these four gates. At each gate, stop work and request human input explicitly. Never guess past a gate.

## The Four Gates

### 1. Design Gate

**Stop when:** You are about to make an architecture change, introduce a new subsystem, or change behavior that is visible to users.

Examples:
- Changing how images are built or composed
- Adding a new pipeline stage or automation system
- Changing defaults that affect what users see or can do
- Restructuring the repo layout or CI model

**Action:** Describe your proposed design clearly: what you're proposing, why, and what you're uncertain about. Ask for human approval before writing code or opening a PR.

---

### 2. Security Gate

**Stop when:** Your change touches authentication, signing, supply chain, secrets handling, or third-party package sources.

Examples:
- Adding a new COPR repo or third-party RPM source
- Changing cosign or SBOM logic
- Adding or modifying secrets in workflows
- Changing how packages are verified or pinned
- Any change to the signing or attestation pipeline

**Action:** Describe exactly which security property is affected and what your proposed approach preserves or changes. Ask for explicit human approval before opening any PR. Security changes require maintainer review regardless of how minor they appear.

---

### 3. Breakage Gate

**Stop when:** Your change removes or renames a public input, changes a default that consuming repos depend on, or could break `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, `dakota`, `aurora`, or `bazzite`.

Examples:
- Renaming or removing a workflow input used by downstream callers
- Changing a system file path that other scripts reference
- Modifying `projectbluefin/actions` in a way that could break consumers
- Changing a dconf key or GSettings schema that affects downstream images

**Action:** Identify all affected consumers before opening the PR. List them in the PR description. Confirm no consumer will silently break. If cross-repo coordination is needed, note that explicitly.

> ⚠️ `common` changes propagate to ALL downstream variants at next build. A broken `system_files/shared/` change breaks `bluefin`, `bluefin-lts`, AND `dakota` simultaneously.

---

### 4. Merge Gate

**Stop when:** Your PR is ready for final review and merge.

This gate is always human. CI passing + `lgtm` label from a human reviewer is required before merge. Auto-merge fires only after both conditions are met.

Agents never self-merge, never bypass branch protection, and never force-push to a protected branch.

---

## How to Signal a Gate

When you hit a gate:

1. Stop. Present what you've done (branch, diff) and what decision is needed — do NOT open a PR yet.
2. Describe the gate clearly:
   ```
   Hitting the Security Gate — need human approval before opening a PR.

   Proposed change: [describe it]
   Security property affected: [what it is]
   My approach: [what you're proposing]
   Alternative approaches: [if any]
   ```
3. Add the `agent/blocked` label to the related issue (not a new PR comment).
4. Wait for explicit human approval before opening a PR.

## Verification Evidence Requirement

Before removing draft status and requesting formal review, ALL of the following must be true:

- [ ] CI is passing (link the run in the PR description)
- [ ] If no automated test covers the change — describe how you manually verified it
- [ ] Skill file update committed in **this same PR** (not a follow-up)
- [ ] PR title follows Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- [ ] Both attribution trailers present on every AI-authored commit:
  ```
  Assisted-by: <Model> via GitHub Copilot
  Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
  ```

Do not request review until all five are checked. A PR without evidence is not ready.

---

## When in Doubt

If you are uncertain whether something hits a gate — it does. Describe what you're doing and what you're uncertain about, and ask. A short human answer costs less than a wrong implementation. Do not open a PR speculatively.
