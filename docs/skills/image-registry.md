# Image Registry

All Bluefin images are published to `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/`. The org migration from `ublue-os` is complete — `projectbluefin` is fully standalone.

## Registry paths

| Registry path | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin:stable` | ✅ Production | Main Bluefin stable stream |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin:latest` | ✅ Production | Main Bluefin latest stream |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin:testing` | ✅ Testing | PR gate + E2E candidate |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-nvidia:stable` | ✅ Production | Bluefin with NVIDIA drivers (closed-source) |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-nvidia:latest` | ✅ Production | Bluefin NVIDIA latest stream |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-nvidia:testing` | ✅ Testing | Bluefin NVIDIA E2E candidate |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-lts:stable` | ✅ Production | LTS stream |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/bluefin-lts:testing` | ✅ Testing | LTS E2E candidate |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common` | ✅ Active | Shared layer (this repo) |
| `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/dakota` | ✅ Active | Dakota image |

## Image flavor naming

Bluefin publishes two flavors, built from the same Containerfile with different `IMAGE_FLAVOR` values:

| Flavor | Image name | `image_flavor` value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | `bluefin` | `main` | Default — no proprietary drivers |
| NVIDIA | `bluefin-nvidia` | `nvidia` | Includes NVIDIA closed-source drivers via akmods |

**Naming rule:** `IMAGE_FLAVOR=main` → image name `bluefin`. All other flavors → `bluefin-{flavor}`. This is implemented in the Justfile `image_name` recipe.

**Do not confuse with upstream package names:** `akmods-nvidia-open` is a `ublue-os` kernel module package pulled at build time — its name is NOT our image name. The image is `bluefin-nvidia`, not `bluefin-nvidia-open`.

> Historical note: the image was erroneously named `bluefin-nvidia-open` prior to 2026-06-07. The rename was applied in bluefin PR #434.

## How runtime tools derive the registry path

```bash
IMAGE_VENDOR="$(jq -r '."image-vendor"' < /usr/share/ublue-os/image-info.json)"
IMAGE_REGISTRY="ghcr.io/${IMAGE_VENDOR}"
```

`image-vendor` is set at build time via `00-image-info.sh`. The helper reads it dynamically — do not hardcode the registry path.

## Build-time ublue-os source (wallpapers only)

The Containerfile pulls wallpaper artwork from `ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin-wallpapers-gnome` as a **build-time COPY source**. This is a read-only upstream artwork dependency and does not violate the ublue-os prohibition. The production image tree and all runtime registries are fully under `ghcr.io/projectbluefin/`. See [`containerfile.md`](containerfile.md) for details.
